Project Description
Title:
MedGuard-Rx: Enhancing Medication Safety with Retrieval-Augmented Clinical QA

Purpose of the Project:
This project aims to improve the quality and safety of clinical decision-making by using advanced AI models to answer medication-related clinical questions in real time. By analyzing anonymous queries submitted by clinicians during their practice, we seek to better understand the types of medication questions that arise and to evaluate the accuracy and safety of AI-generated responses. The insights gained will help optimize clinical question-answering systems and contribute to safer medication use.

What Will Be Collected:
When you use this application, the clinical queries you enter will be securely logged and stored. These queries will NOT include any patient-identifiable information (no names, birth dates, MRNs, or other PHI). Only the content of the query (e.g., "What is the recommended dose of metformin in renal failure?") and limited, non-identifying metadata (such as query timestamp) will be collected for research purposes.

How Your Data Will Be Used:
The data collected will be used solely for research aimed at improving clinical question-answering systems. No attempt will be made to identify users or patients. Findings may be published or presented in scientific forums, but only aggregate and anonymized results will be shared.

Consent Statement
