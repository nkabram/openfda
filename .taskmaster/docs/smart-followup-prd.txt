# Smart Follow-Up Input System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Transform the current multi-button follow-up toolbar into a single, intelligent input area that automatically determines user intent and routes queries appropriately without requiring users to pre-select their desired action type.

## Current State Analysis
- Users must choose between three follow-up modes: FDA Docs, Web Search, and LLM Only
- This creates friction and decision fatigue
- Users may not know which option is best for their query
- Multiple UI elements create visual clutter

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Simplify User Experience**: Replace toolbar buttons with single input field
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically determine user intent and route accordingly
3. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Eliminate need for users to choose follow-up type
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Preserve all current capabilities while improving UX

### Success Metrics
- Reduced user hesitation time before submitting follow-up questions
- Increased follow-up question engagement rate
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Reduced support requests about which follow-up option to choose

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Single Input Interface
- Replace current toolbar with single text input area
- Include submit button or Enter key functionality
- Maintain responsive design across devices
- Preserve accessibility features

### 2. Smart Intent Detection System
The system must classify user queries into three categories:

#### 2.1 Clarification/Additional Questions (LLM Only)
**Intent Indicators:**
- Questions about previously generated content
- Requests for explanation or clarification
- "What does this mean?", "Can you explain...", "Tell me more about..."
- References to specific parts of previous response

**Action:** Process using LLM with conversation context

#### 2.2 New FDA Data Request
**Intent Indicators:**
- New medication names mentioned
- Requests for different drug information
- "What about [drug name]?", "Tell me about [medication]"
- Dosage, interaction, or safety questions for new substances

**Action:** Present "New FDA Search" button for user confirmation

#### 2.3 Web Search Request
**Intent Indicators:**
- Current events or recent news requests
- Comparative studies or research requests
- "Latest research on...", "Recent studies about...", "Current guidelines for..."
- Questions requiring real-time or external information

**Action:** Automatically perform web search

### 3. Intent Classification Logic

#### 3.1 Primary Classification
- Use NLP model to analyze query text
- Consider conversation context and previous responses
- Apply confidence scoring to classification results

#### 3.2 Confidence Thresholds
- **High Confidence (>80%)**: Execute action automatically
- **Medium Confidence (50-80%)**: Present clarification options
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Default to LLM response with option to retry

#### 3.3 Ambiguity Handling
When intent is unclear, present minimal clarification UI:
- "I can help you with that. Would you like me to:"
- Option 1: "Search for new FDA information"
- Option 2: "Search the web for recent information"
- Option 3: "Answer based on the previous response"

### 4. Backend API Requirements

#### 4.1 New Intent Detection Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/api/detect-intent`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: 
  - User query text
  - Conversation context
  - Previous response content
- **Output**:
  - Intent classification (clarification/fda/websearch)
  - Confidence score
  - Suggested action

#### 4.2 Unified Follow-Up Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/api/smart-followup`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**:
  - User query
  - Detected intent
  - Query context
- **Output**:
  - Response content
  - Action taken
  - Suggested follow-ups

### 5. User Experience Flow

#### 5.1 Happy Path - High Confidence
1. User types follow-up question
2. System detects intent with high confidence
3. System automatically executes appropriate action
4. Response displayed with minimal delay

#### 5.2 Ambiguous Intent Path
1. User types follow-up question
2. System detects multiple possible intents
3. Brief clarification UI appears
4. User selects preferred action
5. System executes and remembers preference for similar queries

#### 5.3 Error Handling
1. If intent detection fails, default to LLM response
2. Provide "Try a different approach" options
3. Allow manual override of detected intent

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Intent Detection Model
- Implement using OpenAI GPT for initial version
- Consider fine-tuning for medication-specific queries
- Include context awareness for conversation history

### 2. API Architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Add logging for intent detection accuracy monitoring

### 3. Frontend Components
- Create new `SmartFollowUpInput` component
- Update `MedicationQueryForm` to use new component
- Remove existing toolbar components
- Maintain loading states and progress indicators

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Intent detection should complete within 500ms
- Total response time should not exceed current performance
- Implement caching for common query patterns

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Intent Detection
- Implement intent detection API endpoint
- Create classification logic using OpenAI
- Add confidence scoring system
- Test with sample queries

### Phase 2: Frontend Component
- Create new input component
- Implement clarification UI for ambiguous cases
- Update main form to use new component
- Remove old toolbar components

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Connect frontend to backend APIs
- Implement error handling and fallbacks
- Add analytics for intent detection accuracy
- User testing and feedback collection

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Fine-tune intent detection based on usage data
- Optimize performance and response times
- Add advanced features like query suggestions
- Monitor and improve accuracy metrics

## Success Criteria
1. **Usability**: 90% of users can successfully submit follow-up questions without confusion
2. **Accuracy**: Intent detection accuracy >85% for clear queries
3. **Performance**: No degradation in response times
4. **Adoption**: Increased follow-up question usage by 25%

## Risk Mitigation
- **Intent Misclassification**: Provide easy correction mechanism
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and optimization
- **User Confusion**: Include subtle UI hints and help text
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always allow manual override of detected intent

## Future Enhancements
- Learning from user corrections to improve accuracy
- Personalized intent detection based on user history
- Voice input support for follow-up questions
- Multi-language intent detection support
