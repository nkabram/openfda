# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Natural Language Query Processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system to process natural language medication queries and detect user intent.
# Details:
1. Integrate OpenAI API for natural language processing
2. Create intent detection system for query classification
3. Implement query preprocessing pipeline
4. Develop mapping between detected intents and FDA API endpoints
5. Create query templates for common medication questions
6. Implement entity extraction for medication names and parameters
7. Add confidence scoring for intent detection
8. Create fallback mechanisms for low-confidence queries
9. Implement query refinement suggestions
10. Add logging for query processing steps

# Test Strategy:
1. Test intent detection with sample queries
2. Verify entity extraction for medication names
3. Test mapping between intents and FDA endpoints
4. Verify confidence scoring identifies ambiguous queries
5. Test fallback mechanisms
6. Verify query refinement suggestions are relevant
7. Test with a variety of query types (dosage, ingredients, indications, warnings, adverse reactions)
