# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Supabase for Authentication and Database
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase for user authentication, database storage, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
# Details:
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Install Supabase client: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
3. Configure Supabase client in a utility file
4. Set up environment variables for Supabase URL and API key
5. Create database tables for user profiles, queries, and admin management
6. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
7. Configure foreign key relationships for data integrity
8. Set up authentication providers (email/password, Google OAuth)
9. Create helper functions for database operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test connection to Supabase
2. Verify database schema creation
3. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access
4. Validate foreign key constraints
5. Test authentication flows for both email/password and Google OAuth
6. Verify data isolation between different users
