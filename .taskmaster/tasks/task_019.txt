# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement API Rate Limiting Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add safeguards against excessive API calls that may hit rate limits or cause performance issues, including request deduplication, retry logic, batching, and usage monitoring.
# Details:
1. Implement request deduplication mechanism:
   - Create a request fingerprinting system based on endpoint, parameters, and timestamp
   - Develop a pending request registry to track in-flight API calls
   - Add logic to return cached promises for duplicate requests within a configurable time window
   - Implement cleanup for completed request entries

2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff:
   - Create a configurable retry policy with maximum attempts and backoff factors
   - Implement error detection to identify retryable vs. non-retryable errors
   - Add exponential backoff calculation with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
   - Develop timeout handling for long-running retries
   - Create circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures

3. Implement request batching:
   - Identify API endpoints suitable for batching
   - Create request queue system with configurable batch size and timing
   - Develop batch processor to combine similar requests
   - Implement response demultiplexer to route batched responses back to original requesters
   - Add priority handling for urgent requests that shouldn't wait for batching

4. Add API usage monitoring and logging:
   - Create detailed logging for all API requests, responses, and errors
   - Implement metrics collection for request frequency, latency, and error rates
   - Develop dashboard for visualizing API usage patterns
   - Add alerting for approaching rate limits or unusual patterns
   - Create rate limit tracking to proactively slow requests before hitting limits

5. Implement adaptive throttling:
   - Develop token bucket algorithm for client-side rate limiting
   - Create adaptive throttling based on server response headers
   - Implement priority queuing for critical vs. non-critical requests
   - Add configurable concurrency limits for parallel requests

6. Enhance the existing OpenFDA API client:
   - Integrate the new rate limiting protections with the existing API client
   - Update error handling to work with new retry mechanisms
   - Modify caching strategy to work with deduplication system
   - Add instrumentation for monitoring and metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Test request deduplication:
   - Create unit tests with simultaneous identical API calls
   - Verify only one network request is made for duplicate calls
   - Test edge cases with nearly identical requests
   - Verify correct response is returned to all callers
   - Measure performance impact of deduplication mechanism

2. Test retry logic:
   - Mock API failures to trigger retry mechanism
   - Verify exponential backoff increases wait time between retries
   - Test maximum retry limit enforcement
   - Verify successful retry after temporary failure
   - Test circuit breaker prevents excessive retries

3. Test request batching:
   - Create scenarios with multiple similar requests
   - Verify requests are combined into appropriate batches
   - Test timing of batch processing
   - Verify correct responses are routed back to original requesters
   - Measure performance improvements from batching

4. Test monitoring and logging:
   - Verify all API calls are properly logged
   - Test metrics collection accuracy
   - Verify dashboard displays correct usage patterns
   - Test alerting triggers with simulated high usage
   - Verify rate limit tracking accurately predicts limits

5. Test adaptive throttling:
   - Simulate rate limit responses from server
   - Verify client-side throttling activates appropriately
   - Test priority queuing with mixed critical and non-critical requests
   - Verify concurrency limits are enforced
   - Measure system behavior under high load conditions

6. Integration testing:
   - Test the complete system with real API endpoints
   - Verify all protection mechanisms work together
   - Measure overall performance impact
   - Test with various network conditions and latencies
   - Verify system resilience during API outages or degraded performance
