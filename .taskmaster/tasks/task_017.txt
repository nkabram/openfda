# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Query Cache Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the issue where user queries are fetched from API on every tab switch, page reload, or component mount by implementing a robust client-side query state management system.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current QueryCacheContext implementation to identify why components are bypassing it
2. Enhance the QueryCacheContext to:
   - Store query data in both context state and localStorage/sessionStorage for persistence
   - Implement a versioning mechanism to detect stale cache data
   - Add cache invalidation logic for explicit refresh requests
3. Modify query fetching logic:
   - Create a useQueries hook that leverages the enhanced QueryCacheContext
   - Implement a fetch-once-per-session strategy with cache validation
   - Add incremental state updates for new/modified/deleted queries
4. Update components to use the new query management system:
   - Replace direct API calls to /api/queries with the useQueries hook
   - Add loading states for initial query fetch
   - Implement optimistic updates for query modifications
5. Add cache debugging tools:
   - Create a cache status indicator in development mode
   - Add cache reset functionality for testing
   - Implement detailed cache logging
6. Optimize performance:
   - Add debouncing for rapid component mounts
   - Implement pagination support in the cache
   - Add query filtering/sorting at the cache level to avoid re-processing
7. Handle edge cases:
   - Implement error recovery if cache becomes corrupted
   - Add fallback to API if cache access fails
   - Create cache warming on initial app load

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify network requests to /api/queries are only made once per session by:
   - Using browser network inspector to monitor API calls
   - Testing tab switching, page reloads, and component remounts
   - Confirming subsequent navigation does not trigger redundant API calls
2. Test cache persistence by:
   - Closing and reopening the browser
   - Verifying query data is loaded from cache without API calls
   - Confirming localStorage/sessionStorage contains expected query data
3. Verify incremental updates by:
   - Creating a new query and confirming only the new query is fetched
   - Deleting a query and verifying the cache updates correctly
   - Modifying a query and checking that only the changed query is refreshed
4. Test cache invalidation by:
   - Manually triggering a refresh and confirming API calls are made
   - Simulating cache version mismatch and verifying automatic refresh
   - Testing forced refresh functionality
5. Verify performance improvements by:
   - Measuring and comparing component render times before and after implementation
   - Testing with large query sets to ensure pagination works correctly
   - Confirming UI responsiveness during query operations
6. Test error handling by:
   - Simulating corrupted cache data
   - Testing with localStorage disabled
   - Verifying fallback to API calls works correctly
