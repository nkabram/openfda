# Task ID: 16
# Title: Optimize Authentication State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the issue where user approval status and admin status checks are performed on every page reload by implementing persistent authentication state that only checks status once per session.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current AuthContext implementation to identify where checkApprovalStatus is being called
2. Modify the authentication context to store approval and admin status in localStorage or sessionStorage after initial verification
3. Update the authentication flow to only check status on explicit login events:
   - On successful login, fetch and store approval/admin status
   - On logout, clear the stored status information
4. Implement a mechanism to read status from storage on page reload instead of making API calls
5. Add a function to force status refresh when needed (e.g., after admin actions)
6. Update the useAuth hook to expose the cached status values
7. Ensure proper error handling if stored values become corrupted
8. Add timestamp to stored values to implement optional expiration (e.g., force refresh after 24 hours)
9. Update protected routes to use the cached status values
10. Implement a fallback mechanism to re-fetch status if storage is unavailable
11. Add clear documentation for the authentication state management approach

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that approval status is only checked once per session by monitoring network requests
2. Test that status is correctly stored in localStorage/sessionStorage after login
3. Verify that page reloads do not trigger unnecessary API calls to /api/auth/status
4. Test that logout properly clears stored authentication state
5. Verify that protected routes still function correctly with the cached status
6. Test the force refresh functionality to ensure it updates the stored values
7. Simulate storage unavailability to verify fallback mechanism works
8. Test with multiple browser tabs to ensure consistent authentication state
9. Verify that admin users still have proper access to admin features
10. Test with various user types (approved, unapproved, admin) to ensure correct behavior
11. Measure performance improvement by comparing page load times before and after implementation
