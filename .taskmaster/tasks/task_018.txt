# Task ID: 18
# Title: Enhance Query Cache Implementation with Advanced Caching Strategies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the existing QueryCacheContext to extend cache duration, implement selective invalidation, add cross-tab persistence, enable background refresh for stale data, and ensure proper cache utilization in query components.
# Details:
1. Analyze current QueryCacheContext implementation:
   - Review the existing 5-minute cache duration mechanism
   - Identify components that bypass the cache
   - Map query patterns and frequency of API calls

2. Extend cache duration to session-based:
   - Modify cache configuration to maintain validity for the entire user session
   - Implement cache expiration tied to session timeout or explicit logout
   - Add configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) settings per query type

3. Implement selective cache invalidation:
   - Create a dependency tracking system to identify related queries
   - Develop a tagging system to categorize queries by data domain
   - Implement invalidation functions that target specific query types or tags
   - Add mutation tracking to automatically invalidate affected queries

4. Add cache persistence across browser tabs:
   - Implement localStorage/sessionStorage integration for cache data
   - Create a versioning system to handle concurrent modifications
   - Add cross-tab communication using BroadcastChannel API or localStorage events
   - Implement cache synchronization when tabs detect changes

5. Implement background refresh for stale data:
   - Create a background worker to refresh near-expiring cache entries
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern to serve cached data while updating
   - Add priority queue for refresh operations based on usage patterns
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed refresh attempts

6. Ensure proper cache utilization in query components:
   - Create or update useQuery hook to leverage enhanced cache
   - Add cache status indicators (fresh, stale, fetching) to components
   - Implement forced refresh options for user-initiated updates
   - Add debugging tools to monitor cache hit/miss rates

7. Optimize cache storage:
   - Implement compression for large cached responses
   - Add size limits and LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policies
   - Create cache pruning mechanisms for outdated or rarely accessed data

8. Add cache analytics and monitoring:
   - Implement cache performance metrics (hit rate, size, invalidations)
   - Create developer tools for cache inspection and manual management
   - Add logging for cache operations to aid debugging

# Test Strategy:
1. Cache Duration Tests:
   - Verify cached data persists throughout user session
   - Test that cache survives page refreshes and navigation
   - Confirm cache expires appropriately on session timeout or logout

2. Selective Invalidation Tests:
   - Create test scenarios with interdependent queries
   - Verify that modifying data invalidates only related queries
   - Test tag-based invalidation affects all queries with matching tags
   - Confirm unrelated queries remain cached after invalidations

3. Cross-Tab Persistence Tests:
   - Open multiple browser tabs and verify cache sharing
   - Test cache updates propagate across tabs
   - Verify concurrent modifications resolve correctly
   - Test edge cases like tab disconnection and reconnection

4. Background Refresh Tests:
   - Verify stale data is served while refresh occurs in background
   - Test refresh priority queue handles high-demand scenarios
   - Confirm exponential backoff works for failed refresh attempts
   - Measure performance impact of background operations

5. Component Integration Tests:
   - Verify components correctly utilize the cache
   - Test cache status indicators reflect actual cache state
   - Confirm forced refresh options work as expected
   - Verify components don't trigger unnecessary API calls

6. Performance Tests:
   - Measure reduction in API calls compared to previous implementation
   - Test cache performance with large datasets
   - Verify compression reduces storage requirements
   - Test LRU eviction policy correctly removes least used items

7. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create user flows that exercise the cache system
   - Verify application functions correctly with enhanced caching
   - Test cache behavior during poor network conditions
   - Confirm cache analytics provide accurate metrics

8. Regression Tests:
   - Verify all existing functionality works with new cache implementation
   - Test backward compatibility with components not yet updated
